# Home_automation_system
SmartHomeX is a mobile-based home automation system utilizing 8051 microcontroller and advanced microprocessor technology for seamless control over home automation devices.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The system offers an intuitive and user-friendly GUI developed in C++, allowing users to interact with home automation devices effortlessly.

- **Mobile Device Control:** SmartHomeX enables users to control home automation devices using their Android mobile devices. The system establishes a Bluetooth connection between the mobile device and the home automation system, providing on-the-go control and monitoring capabilities.

- **Real-time Simulation:** The project utilizes Proteus simulation software to provide real-time simulation of the SmartHomeX system. This allows users to visualize and verify the functionality of the home automation system before implementation.
